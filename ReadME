# Pong Game - Python Turtle Implementation
This is a simple **Pong game** built using Python's built-in `turtle` library. The game is structured in a modular way with separate files for the paddle, ball, and scoreboard classes. Players use keyboard controls to move their paddles and compete to score points.

## Features
- **Two-player Pong Game**:
    - Player 1 uses the `w` and `s` keys to move the left paddle up and down.
    - Player 2 uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move the right paddle.

- **Scoreboard**:
    - Player 1 scores when the ball passes Player 2's paddle.
    - Player 2 scores when the ball passes Player 1's paddle.
    - The scoreboard is displayed and updated dynamically on the screen.

- **Speed Increment**:
    - Every time the ball hits a paddle, its speed increases gradually, creating a progressively challenging game.

## Game Controls
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle)**:
    - `W` key to move up.
    - `S` key to move down.

- **Player 2 (Right Paddle)**:
    - `Up Arrow` key to move up.
    - `Down Arrow` key to move down.

## Gameplay Rules
1. The ball starts moving randomly toward one of the players.
2. Players must use their paddles to bounce the ball back.
3. If a player misses the ball and it crosses their side, the opponent scores a point.
4. After scoring, the ball resets to the center and continues gameplay.
5. The ball speed gradually increases after every paddle hit, making the game harder as it progresses.

## Demo

## Future Improvements (Suggestions)
- Add a "Game Over" screen or set a winning score limit.
- Add sound effects for paddle hits, wall collisions, and scoring points.
- Allow customization of paddle/ball size, speed, and gameplay settings.
- Make it single-player by implementing AI for Player 2.
